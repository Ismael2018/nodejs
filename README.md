With this tutorial, I only worked on the backend. The frontend was directly provided by the teacher, Will Alexander.

I learned about how to
    build an express server with routes and controllers
    implement CRUD operations for a MongoDB database with express and mongoose
    add authentication with bcrypt and JWT
    add file downloading with multer


Many thanks to Will Alexander and OpenClassrooms for this great tutorial.
